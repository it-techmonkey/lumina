      <p>
        If you are reporting damage or a possible fault, please do not fit, alter, or install the

        packaging may be required and additional charges may apply.

        we will arrange a suitable resolution.

        refund an order where there is a payment issue, pricing error, stock issue, delivery
        restriction, or internal processing error.

    title: 'Delivery Issues',

      <p>
        Lumina orders are made to measure and dispatched after production. Delivery may require a
        signature. If a courier is unable to complete delivery after repeated attempts, re-delivery
        charges may apply. Items returned to us by the courier may be held for a limited period
        before disposal.

      <p>
        Lumina blinds include a <strong>1-year manufacturer&apos;s guarantee</strong> against
        confirmed manufacturing faults. This does not cover normal wear and tear, accidental damage,
        misuse, incorrect installation, alterations, fading from prolonged sunlight exposure, or use
        in unsuitable conditions.

      <p>
        As with all made-to-measure blinds, small manufacturing tolerances can occur. Please allow
        for a variance of <strong>+/- 4mm</strong>. If a blind falls within this tolerance, it is
        not deemed faulty and will not qualify for replacement or rejection on that basis.
