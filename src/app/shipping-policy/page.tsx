      <p>
        Every Lumina blind is made to order, so your product enters production after your order is
        confirmed. Unless a different estimate is shown on the product page or in your order
        communications, orders are usually delivered within <strong>7-11 business days</strong>.
        Once your blind has been completed and handed to the courier, we will send a shipping
        confirmation email with tracking details.
